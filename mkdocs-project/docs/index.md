# Open Water Foundation / Learn C #

## Introduction ##

This documentation provides an overview of important C programming language concepts, with best practices
and working examples.  The documentation has been created by the Open Water Foundation to facilitate our
work and is being made available in the hopes that it also helps others.

If you are reading this documentation, you have likely already decided that C is the language that
you want to use for programming.  It is assumed that you have a basic understanding of programming and
the C language.  There are other sources of information about C.  This documentation focuses
on practical issues that, if handled well, will minimize frustration and increase the efficiency of
software development.

**This documentation is a work in progress and will contain notes for inserts for awhile until time can
be devoted to filling in blanks.**

## About the Open Water Foundation ##

The [Open Water Foundation](http://openwaterfoundation.org) is a 501(c)3 nonprofit social enterprise that focuses
on developing and supporting open source software for water resources, so that organizations can make better decisions about water.
OWF has created this documentation to educate its staff and other developers that are working on C software.

## How to Use This Documentation ##

This documentation is not intended to be a full reference for the C language but focuses on important topics that
will help a C programmer understand important technical concepts and be successful with software tools.

The documentation is organized in the order of basic concepts and steps needed to build a C program.
As time allows, additional sections will be added for more advanced topics such as use of useful C
API libraries for water resources.
